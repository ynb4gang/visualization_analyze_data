# **Data Analysis Toolkit**  

## **Overview**  
This toolkit combines regression analysis, clustering, and time series forecasting into a single project. It is designed for researchers, data scientists, and developers who want a reliable and customizable solution for their data challenges.  

### **Features**  
- **Regression Analysis**: Predict outcomes using Random Forest Regression with automatic hyperparameter tuning and advanced visualizations.  
- **Clustering**: Perform K-Means clustering with PCA for dimensionality reduction and silhouette scoring to determine the optimal number of clusters.  
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Predict trends using AutoTS, including automatic model selection and confidence intervals.
